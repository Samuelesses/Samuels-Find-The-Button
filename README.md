**Greg and the Button** is a story game where you play as ‘Greg’. Similar to ‘The Stanley Parable,’ but in an indie ‘Find the button’ format. In this short game, you find buttons while metaphorically fighting with the narrator.

## How To Play
1. Download & Extract the zip folder.
2. Run 'Greg And The Button.exe'!

## Insperation
The Stanly Parable was a big insperation for this project, it guided the idea that the narrorator of a story can play a larger part than just narrorationg.

## Endings
1. 'The Leg Ending'
2. 'The Found Legs' (Requires 'The Leg Ending' Unlocked)
3. 'The Real Ending' - Complete the game normally!

## DEMO NOTE
This is unfinished, and I reccomend when playing though, you attempt all endings for the full experince. For the 'Real ending' there is only 3 levels for now.
